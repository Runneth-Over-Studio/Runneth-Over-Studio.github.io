# Privacy Policy
**Last Updated:** 19 Febuary 2024
**Runneth Over Studio, LLC**

Runneth Over Studio, LLC (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle personal information across all websites, software, games, applications, and services developed or published by Runneth Over Studio, LLC (collectively, the “Services”).

Our philosophy is simple: **we do not collect, track, or share any personal data unless you explicitly provide it for use within the application itself**, and that data remains stored **locally on your own device**.

---

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- Personal information
- Telemetry or usage analytics
- Crash reports (automatic transmission)
- Cookies or tracking identifiers
- IP addresses
- Geolocation data
- Behavioral or preference data
- Advertising identifiers
- Third-party analytics data (Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, etc.)

We also **do not use**:

- Advertising SDKs
- Analytics SDKs
- External tracking scripts
- Social media plugins that transmit user activity

In short: **we don’t track you, profile you, or analyze any usage patterns.**

---

## 2. Information You May Provide

Some applications we develop may allow you to voluntarily enter data for the purpose of using that application (e.g., login credentials for external services, configuration settings, preferences, or game save data).

When such data is entered:

- It is stored **locally on your device**.
- It is **never sent to Runneth Over Studio, LLC**.
- It is used **only** by the application for the functionality you choose.
- You may delete it at any time (via in-app settings or by removing the application’s data folder).

We do **not** retain copies of this information.

---

## 3. Local Application Data

Our software may store information on your device such as:

- Configuration or settings files
- Save files
- Credentials you choose to store for convenience
- Temporary cache files
- Log files (local only)

All such data is stored **solely on your device** within standard application directories (e.g., AppData, local game folders, Linux config directories, etc.).

We do not and cannot access these files.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our software and websites do **not** directly use or integrate any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking technologies.

If an application interacts with an external service (e.g., a cloud API or online account), that interaction:

- Occurs only because you initiated it,
- Is governed by the third party’s own privacy policy, and
- Does not transmit information to us.

We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of external services.

---

## 5. Cookies (Website)

Our website is designed to operate **without cookies**.

We do not use cookies for analytics, personalization, advertising, or tracking.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Our Services are designed to function fully without collecting personal data from any user.

If you believe an application or service has inadvertently collected personal information, please contact us so we can assist you in removing it.

---

## 7. Security

Because we do not collect or store personal data on our systems, your privacy is fundamentally protected by design.

Any sensitive information you choose to store within our software (such as API keys or login credentials) is stored **only on your device**.
You are responsible for safeguarding access to your device, operating system, and local storage.

---

## 8. Your Control and Choices

Because all user-entered data is stored locally:

- You may delete local data at any time.
- Uninstalling the application removes its stored data (unless your OS retains save files by default).
- Updating or reinstalling software does not send any data to us.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we ever revise our data practices, we will:

- Update this Privacy Policy, and
- Change the “Last Updated” date at the top of the page.

If changes are significant, we will also provide notice on our website or within the affected applications.

The version on this webpage is the authoritative, official version.
