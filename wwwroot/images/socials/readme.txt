All SVGs made available from: https://free-icons.github.io/free-icons/

To convert to PNG, I:
    Created a new Inkscape SVG with a very simple line path.
    In an editor, replaced the path with the one from free-icons.github.io
    Updated the style; style="fill:#b46060;fill-opacity:1;stroke:#b46060;stroke-width:0.422408px;stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-opacity:1"
    Updated the view box; viewBox="0 0 512 512"
        This required that I:
            Resized the page to the selection. 
            Realign and save.
            Back in the editor, update the view box again.
            Then reopen in Inkscape, lock the dimensions and set the width to 210.109.
            Final realign and save.
